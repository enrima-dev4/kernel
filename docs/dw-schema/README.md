dw-schema
=============
dw_schema1.pdf contains the first version of the EnRiMa Data-Warehouse schema (presented at the Trondheim mtg). The DW schema is completely transparent for the client applications, and does not depend on the SMS (Symbolic Model Specification); therefore it is posted here only for documentation purposes
